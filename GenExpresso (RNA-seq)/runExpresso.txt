### Instructions to Run the GenExpresso Project

Step 1: Download Requirements
Before running the project, ensure you have installed all the required Python libraries. To do this, run the following command:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Step 2: Access the Virtual Environment
Make sure you activate the virtual environment to isolate the project's dependencies. Use the following command:
```
source ge_envmac/bin/activate
```

Step 3: Apply Database Migrations
Ensure that the database is up to date with the latest models. Run:
```
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

Step 4: Run the Development Server
To start the Django development server, use the following command:
```
python manage.py runserver
```

Step 5: Access the Application
Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to:
http://127.0.0.1:8000

Step 6: Stop the Server and Deactivate the Environment (Optional)
When you are done, you can stop the server using `Ctrl+C` and deactivate the virtual environment with:
```
deactivate
```

That's it! You are now ready to run and test the GenExpresso project. For any issues or questions, reach out to the project team.
